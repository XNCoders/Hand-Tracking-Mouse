<h1>Hand Tracking Mouse</h1>

This project is a simple demonstration of using hand tracking to control the computer mouse. It uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand detection and tracking, and PyAutoGUI to control the mouse cursor.
<h2>Requirements</h2>

This project requires the following libraries:
<ul>
  <li>OpenCV</li>
  <li>MediaPipe</li>
  <li>PyAutoGUI</li>
</ul>
  
You can install these libraries using pip:

  <code>pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui</code>

<h2>Usage</h2>

To use this program, simply run the hand_tracking_mouse.py file:

<code>python hand_tracking_mouse.py</code>

Once the program is running, it will use your computer's webcam to detect and track your hand movements. You can move your hand around to control the mouse cursor. To click, make a fist with your hand.

Press the 'q' key to quit the program.
